# EVE Character Settings Copier
  
Hi there!  
Since the old GarpaUI was outdated and still trying to use the old EVE API, i thought i'd make a new application that does the same thing but uses ESI, the new API, and therefor shows the correct info.  

**Folder used to store backups:** *%appdata%/EVECSC/Backups*
  
## What it can do:  
 - Replace settings files for characters within specified folder with the settings file from the selected character  
 - backup and restore specific character files  
   
## What it cannot do:  
 - Copy/Backup account specific settings files, simply because there is no way to identify them.
 - Copy between different settings folders.
  
## Issues  
Report bugs/issues in the issues section, and i will check them out.
